## About My Mentor

My mentor, Edward G. Robinson III, from Morgan State University, is a distinguished sports journalist and academic. As a Professor of Practice and Director of the Center for the Study of Race & Culture in Sports, his work focuses on the intersection of race, culture, and sports. He leverages his extensive experience in journalism, his academic background, and his passion for sports to explore and address important issues within the African American community and beyond. His notable projects include a study on African-American female athletes commissioned by ESPNâ€™s Undefeated and the launch of the Black SoccerLab, a think tank dedicated to soccer in the African American community and the African Diaspora.
