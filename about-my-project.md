## About My Project

Leveraging AI Technology to Advance Traditional Sports Reporting

Problem: Traditional sports reporting faces challenges in delivering real-time, concise, and engaging content to diverse audiences. The current methods often lack the speed and personalization needed to keep up with the fast-paced nature of sports events. There is a need for an innovative solution that can automatically generate accurate and comprehensive sports news reports immediately following the conclusion of sporting events, tailored to different locales and languages, while adhering to journalistic ethics. 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Literature Review: Conduct a literature review to understand how journalism companies are currently implementing AI technology in their daily media content. This will provide a foundation for integrating AI into sports reporting.

  - Generative AI Development: Explore Generative AI to develop text and video software capable of creating sports news reports based on live game results. This involves training AI models to generate human-like summaries and video segments using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
    
  - Dataset Utilization: Use machine learning to analyze and utilize datasets created by J.R. Jackson and JRSportBrief Trademarks. This includes mining existing sports content to create a robust database that the AI can draw from to generate reports.
    
  - Fact-Finding and Client Interaction: Engage in fact-finding to understand the requirements and preferences of potential news clients. Conduct interviews and surveys to gather insights on how the AI-generated content should be designed to meet their specific needs.
    
  - Prototype Development:
Work to develop a prototype of the AI tool that integrates the findings from the literature review, generative AI exploration, and client interactions. The prototype will be tested for accuracy, relevance, and engagement in producing one-minute sports news segments.
  
Expected Outcome: The completed project will provide sports fans with an innovative way to digest content.

The project is expected to conclude with a conference poster presentation at the end of the program, focusing on the leverage AI provides in advancing sports journalism.
