5/27 - Monday - Memorial day, no institute.

5/28 - Tuesday
The day started with breakfast, followed by a warm welcome and introductions. It was exciting to meet all the participants and mentors. We then had an institute orientation where we got a better understanding of what to expect. After a break to set up our tests, I took the placement test. Post-lunch, we had our first mentor meeting in Room 112. We ended the day with a transition to labs and a research lab orientation.

5/29 - Wednesday
Another early start with breakfast. The sessions began with an overview of the week and the much-anticipated placement reveal. We dived into the fundamentals of Python with sessions on conditionals, operators, and functions. After a break, we covered lists and loops. Lunch was a good time to catch up with my project team and discuss our ideas. The afternoon was spent learning how to think like a programmer and getting an introduction to data analysis with Pandas and NumPy.

5/30 - Thursday
Breakfast kicked off the day again. We explored the world of AI research and had an introduction to machine learning with Scikit-Learn. This was followed by sessions on dictionaries and classes & objects. The Responsible Conduct of Research session was enlightening and highlighted the importance of ethics in research. Lunch provided a nice break and a chance to bond with my teammates. Post-lunch, we had a fun team ice breaker session and continued with data analysis and website building with GitHub.

5/31 - Friday
The last day of the week started with breakfast. The Art of Mentoring session was insightful and provided great advice on building meaningful mentor-mentee relationships. We continued our journey into machine learning with Scikit-Learn Part 2. The sessions on inheritance in OOP and using Git and GitHub were highly informative. After lunch, we had a social networking event and professional headshots session. It was a great opportunity to connect with others and get a professional headshot taken.

Overall, it was an intense but rewarding week filled with learning and networking opportunities. I'm looking forward to applying what I've learned and continuing to grow in the weeks to come.
