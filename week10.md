7/29 - Monday

The start of Week 10 had us back in the research labs, wrapping up our final projects. We spent the morning refining our models and ensuring everything was in top shape for the final presentations. It felt good to see how far we’ve come and to put the finishing touches on our work. Lunch was on our own, a good time to relax and recharge. The afternoon was spent running final tests and preparing our presentation materials for the symposium. It was a busy day, but the excitement for the upcoming symposium was palpable.

7/30 - Tuesday

Today was the big day – the Final Research Symposium. We arrived early to set up our presentations and get everything ready. The morning was a whirlwind of activity, with everyone putting the last-minute touches on their displays and practicing their talks. Lunch was provided, giving us a chance to refuel and relax before the presentations began. The symposium itself was a fantastic experience. It was great to see the variety of projects and to share our own work with a broader audience. The feedback we received was invaluable, and it was inspiring to see the passion and dedication of our peers.

7/31 - Wednesday

After the excitement of the symposium, we were back in the labs. The morning was spent debriefing and discussing the feedback we received. It was a useful exercise, helping us to see our work from different perspectives and identify areas for further improvement. Lunch on our own was a nice break. The afternoon was a special treat – the End of Summer Social at Bearcade in the Student Center. It was a fun and relaxing way to unwind after the intense lead-up to the symposium. We enjoyed games, snacks, and great conversations with our peers.

Overall, Week 10 was a mix of intense preparation, rewarding presentations, and reflective closure. The Final Research Symposium was a highlight, showcasing the incredible work of our peers and providing a fitting culmination to our efforts. The end-of-summer social was a great way to celebrate our achievements and unwind. I’m grateful for the experience and excited to see where our hard work will lead us next
