6/3 - Monday

The week began with a concerted effort on advancing our research through literature review. I spent the morning scouring academic databases, industry reports, and news articles to identify journalism companies implementing AI technology in public media content. Despite facing challenges in accessing comprehensive and recent data, I persevered and managed to gather valuable insights into AI adoption in journalism. In the afternoon, I dedicated time to complete my CITI training, ensuring compliance with research ethics and regulations.

6/4 - Tuesday

Continuing our research-oriented focus, I delved deeper into the literature, analyzing and synthesizing information gathered from various sources. The group writing session provided an opportunity to collaborate with peers, enhancing our understanding of AI implementations in journalism. Lunch offered a brief break before diving back into the literature, where I refined our understanding of specific case studies and their implications.

6/5 - Wednesday

Wednesday was dedicated to furthering our exploration of AI technology in journalism. I spent the day meticulously reviewing and organizing the collected information, focusing on identifying common trends and challenges faced by journalism companies in adopting AI. Lunch provided a moment of respite before diving back into the literature to refine our analysis and extract actionable insights.

6/6 - Thursday

The day commenced with a continued focus on literature review and analysis. I dedicated time to clarifying terminologies and contextualizing findings within the broader scope of journalism and media studies. Lunch on my own allowed for reflection and consolidation of ideas before returning to the literature in the afternoon. I concluded the day with a sense of progress, having deepened our understanding of AI adoption in journalism and its implications for future research.

6/7 - Friday

As the week drew to a close, I dedicated the morning to finalizing our literature review documentation, ensuring all key findings and insights were accurately captured. The afternoon was spent reflecting on the week's progress and outlining next steps for our research. Despite the challenges faced in accessing comprehensive data, the week proved fruitful in advancing our understanding of AI technology in journalism.

Overall, Week 2 was characterized by an intensive focus on literature review and research orientation. The insights gained will serve as a solid foundation for the next stages of our project, guiding our approach and informing future directions. I look forward to building upon this progress in the weeks to come.
