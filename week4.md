6/17 - Monday

Intro to LaTeX
The day began with an introductory session on LaTeX. It was highly informative, providing a solid foundation on using this typesetting system for technical and scientific documentation. We learned about basic commands, document structure, and how to create various elements like tables, figures, and bibliographies. Focused on a group writing session and then we had ice breaker activities involving high school teachers and undergraduate students. It was a great opportunity to network, share experiences, and build camaraderie. In the afternoon, I continued my work in the research labs, making significant progress in my experiments and data analysis.

6/18 - Tuesday

The morning and afternoon were dedicated to investigating research methods used in Generative AI for text and video generation. I focused specifically on understanding Transformers, a key model in this field. I reviewed literature on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and sequence-to-sequence models for text and voice synthesis. This included technical steps such as exploring the architecture and applications of Transformers in generating coherent and contextually accurate text.

6/19 - Wednesday

Juneteenth (No Institute)
Today is Juneteenth, a day to commemorate the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. There were no official institute activities scheduled, allowing time for reflection and personal projects.

6/20 - Thursday

NASA Trip (Restricted to US Nationals ONLY)
I resumed work in the lab, integrating some of the new ideas and perspectives gained during the visit into my project.The focus today was on investigating research methods used in Generative AI for text and video generation. Kept reviewing literature on Generative AI and improving efforts on work completed on tuesday.

6/21 - Friday
Excused Abscense Day- For med class.

Overall, it was a week filled with learning, research, and collaboration, with each day offering unique experiences and insights. I look forward to applying what Iâ€™ve learned and continuing my project in the coming weeks.
