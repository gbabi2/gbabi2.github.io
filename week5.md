6/24 - Monday

Kicked off the week with a full day in the research labs, diving deep into our Generative AI project. I spent most of the day training the T5 and GPT-2 models using our extended dictionary. It was exciting to see the models start to learn and adapt. After a quick lunch break, I got back to refining the training process, making sure everything was running smoothly. It felt great to see some progress by the end of the day.

6/25 - Tuesday

Another day, another deep dive into the world of AI in the research labs. Continued the training of the T5 and GPT-2 models, tweaking them to get better results. Took a short lunch break and then jumped right back in. The afternoon was spent troubleshooting and optimizing the models, which was challenging but rewarding. It’s fascinating to see how small changes can significantly impact the model's performance.

6/26 - Wednesday

Focused on the research labs again today, pushing forward with the training of our AI models. Spent the morning evaluating outputs from the T5 and GPT-2 models and making necessary adjustments. Took a break for lunch, then started preparing for a presentation I’d be giving to high school students tomorrow. It was a busy day, but I felt productive and ready for the challenge ahead.

6/27 - Thursday

Started the day with more work in the research labs, fine-tuning the AI models. Mid-morning, I stepped out to give a presentation to a group of high school students about AI. It was great to see their enthusiasm and curiosity. After lunch, I went back to the labs, inspired by the morning's interaction. Spent the afternoon incorporating feedback into our models and ensuring they could handle a wider range of inputs. It was a fulfilling day, both for the project and personally.

6/28 - Friday

Wrapped up the week in the research labs, focusing on finalizing the fine-tuning of our AI models. Took a quick lunch break, then spent the afternoon documenting the week's progress and planning the next steps. Summarized our findings and the adjustments made, feeling accomplished with the progress. It’s been a week of hard work and tangible results, setting a strong foundation for what’s next.

Overall, Week 3 was intense but incredibly rewarding. The highlight was definitely the presentation to high school students, which was a refreshing break from the lab and a chance to share our passion for AI. I'm excited to continue building on this progress in the coming weeks.
